# 1. Overview of the statistical analysis of BikeSharing

The objective of the challenge is to prepare a story on tableau with the goal to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

As a background the bicycle was for years the means of transport used by just about everybody, young and old, until it was discarded with the advent of the car. Cities began to grow, and mobility became a problem: traffic, noise, gridlock, and pollution. It was passé to pedal, de rigueur to drive. And so the bike was relegated to minority transport mode: for those without money, especially sensitive towards the environment, or politically motivated against motor vehicles. This vision, however, has been overturned in recent years and all over the world. The bicycle is becoming the necessary mobility solution once again and one our cities need. Compared to other transport modes, the positive externalities of the use of the bicycle affect both the individual and the community as a whole. It is the vehicle of change for a better society.

# 2.	Results

## 2.1 Gender breakdown

It is important to know how each gender reply to this service. The total population that utilizes the bike-sharing is 2.3 million. In the following chart, it is possible to see that the 65% (1,530,272) are male, 25% (588,431) are female and 10% (225,521) is unknow.

This is clear picture that bike-sharing is more use for male. As a hypothesis of this behavior, it may be possible that woman may consider to the bikes sensitive in terms of safety and security. 

## 2.2 Peak Hours

It is necessary to understand he behavior of the demand during the peak hours to have a good inventory and a good maintenance of the bikes. The next graph shows the most demanded hours for the service of bike-sharing.

The peak hours are clearly mark by the working and/or school hours. From 6 am to 9am which are the time to be depart from home to either school or work and from 16pm to 19pm which are the hours to return to home. This graph help to have a clear vision on which are the best schedules to provide maintenance to the bikes and to know when to have all the bikes ready at its parking. 

## 2.3 Checkout times for all users

The following graph explains the trip duration and the number of bikes demanded. As it is possible to see the peak is within a 5 minutes trip duration with more than 146 thousand bikes. It is a clear trend that most of the bike trips are to go all over short distances. Most of them within a range of less than one hour.

## 2.4 Checkout times by gender

This graph is related to the two previous ones. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95872614/160320854-0dc07d1a-7e48-42df-8da5-acd7014fe3dd.png)

It is possible to observed that male demand more the service and their trip duration is around 5 minutes, while woman is significantly less with a trip duration of 6 minutes. 
It is possible to conclude that the main constraints for both genders are environmental factors related to traffic conditions, motorist aggression and safety. Issues of safety, comfort and accessibility to destinations appear to be more important to women’s overall travel behavior than to men. This may partly explain the low transport cycling rates for women. Women are more likely than men to report safety concerns as constraining their transport cycling

## 2.5 Trips by weekday by hour

This chart shows how demanded is the bike-sharing service during the week and by hour.

The chart reveals that from Monday to Friday at 8am to 9am is one of the most demanded schedules, follow by Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 17pm to 19pm. These two scheduled clearly underline the behavioral trend of mobility to go to school and work. It is interesting to see the low demand from 10am to 15pm which reinforce the beforementioned statement. Also, it is interesting to analyze the weekend has a completely opposite behavior than during working day, the most demanded time for Saturday and Sunday is 12pm to 17pm which make sense, because most of the population may use this time as a spare time. 

## 2.6 Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
This chart again reinforces the abovementioned charts. It is possible to see the number of trips by gender, weekday, and hour.

Again, is clear gender gap. Another explanation to this behavior may be that Women’s aversion to risk is higher than men’s, also t’s hard to grocery shop for a family and drop kids off at soccer and school on a bicycle and harassment. Female clothes are not friendly with the use of a bike such as skirts, dresses, or pantyhose. 

## 2.7 User trips by gender
Finally, this last chart reinforces the beforementioned statement about the gender gap. It is very clear to see that men subscribe significantly more to bike-sharing than women.

# 3. Summary

-	There is a clear gender gap in the bike-sharing service. Men’s total bicycle trips surpass women’s by a ratio of at least 2:1. Females have different perceptions of safety and different trip needs.
-	There is a clear seasonality on the demand days, where peak day are working days from Monday to Friday.
-	There is a clear seasonality on the demand schedules or time, the peak hours are clearly mark by the working and/or school time. From 6 am to 9am which are the time to be depart from home to either school or work and from 16pm to 19pm which are the hours to return to home.
-	Two additional visualizations suggested for future analysis are: the average distance travel and socio-economic-education level from the bike-sharing users. Perhaps a third element of analysis would be to visualize the growth rates per gender in bike-sharing.
